Description:

The bean 'conventionErrorViewResolver', defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/webmvc/autoconfigure/error/ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration$DefaultErrorViewResolverConfiguration.class], could not be registered. A bean with that name has already been defined in class path resource [org/springframework/boot/autoconfigure/web/servlet/error/ErrorMvcAutoConfiguration$DefaultErrorViewResolverConfiguration.class] and overriding is disabled.

Action:

Consider renaming one of the beans or enabling overriding by setting spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true
